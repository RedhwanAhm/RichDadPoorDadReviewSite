            <p class="p2-header-bq right-align">
                Since Kiyosaki and his wife were financially free at an early age, everyone kept asking them, “How did you do it?” So they thought this could be a great opportunity to share the Rich Dad principles that got them to this point.
            </p>
            <p class="p2-header-bq right-align">
                They asked ourselves, “How can we best deliver what we did in a way that was accessible to everyone?” That was when they created the CASHFLOW® board game in 1996. This game teaches, in a fun and entertaining way, exactly what they did to get out of the Rat Race and achieve financial freedom.

            <p class="p2-header-bq left-align">
                As the game was getting known, they decided they needed a brochure to market the game. Kiyosaki began writing the brochure…and writing…and writing…and writing. That brochure became the basis of the book Rich Dad Poor Dad.

                They self-published Rich Dad Poor Dad in April 1997. The book was on the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and Businessweek bestseller lists for years. In 2000, Oprah called and Kiyosaki appeared on her show. That show and the book went worldwide in an instant. Today, Rich Dad Poor Dad has become the #1 bestselling personal finance book of all time!
